# Introduction

Hello there! üëã
Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Tjorben and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Molecular Life Science. I have a strong interest in the field of Bioinformatics and I am constantly exploring ways to merge my passion for biology with my programming skills.

# Blogging and Technology
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also an avid writer for the blog [Basic-Tutorials](https://www.basic-tutorials.de). This platform allows me to share my knowledge and insights on various technological topics and devices.

# GitHub Contributions
Currently, I am actively involved in several web projects on GitHub, primarily working with the AStA (General Students' Committee) of the University of L√ºbeck (@asta-uzl). One of the notable projects I am contributing to is the development of the Altklausurensystem (past exam system). Through these projects, I am gaining valuable experience in web development and software engineering.
